# 🦀 Rustlator

**Rustlator** is a simple **command-line calculator** written in **Rust** — built to learn Rust fundamentals like `match`, `enum`, `stdin`, and clean CLI structure.

This repo includes **two versions** to show progression:
- ✅ **v1** — A basic version using simple `if`/`else`
- ✅ **v2** — Improved with idiomatic Rust: `enum` + `match` + better error handling

## 🚀 Features

- 📌 Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus
- 📌 Takes input directly from the terminal
- 📌 Handles zero division gracefully
- 📌 Clear structure for learning Rust basics
